# Hackernews
Hackernews is a news listing site that calls data from News API at [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org).

## How to Implement Files
1. Clone the repository
... Copy the repository url to your clip board and run the following command on your git bash command line:
... `git clone https://github.com/annessca/hackernews.git` 
... This will create the project folder in your local system

2. Open the `index.html` file in any browser that is connected to the internet.

## Functionality and Performance
The webpage is created with an **infinite scroll** program. On getting to the bottom of the window, the webpage begins to load more data from the `AJAX` called API.


Every featured news has a headline and a description. When you click on a news headline, the webpage will be redirected to the original news source for the complete information.

## Technologies Used
The webpage is built with a little bit of `HTML`, `CSS` and a whole lot of `Vanilla JavaScript`. The calls to the API is made with the use of `AJAX`.
